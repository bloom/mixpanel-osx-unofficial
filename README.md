# Using Mixpanel Analytics on OS X #

This is an unofficial port of the Mixpanel API to Cocoa, its built with cocoapods in mind.

# Installation

1. Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) with `gem install cocoapods`.
2. Create a file in your XCode project called `Podfile` and add the following line:

        pod 'Mixpanel-OSX-Community'

3. Run `pod install` in your xcode project directory. CocoaPods should download and
install the Mixpanel library, and create a new Xcode workspace. Open up this workspace in Xcode.
4. Add the following to your `AppDelegate.m`:

        #import <Mixpanel/Mixpanel.h>

        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
            [Mixpanel sharedInstanceWithToken:MIXPANEL_TOKEN];
        }

5. Start tracking actions in your app:

        [[Mixpanel sharedInstance] track:@"Watched video" properties:@{@"duration": @53}];
